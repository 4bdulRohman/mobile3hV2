<p>Flutter is an open source framework created by Google. Google made flutter with the goal of building a framework to create a modern, native UI and reactive that can run on both iOS and Android operating systems. Flutter is programmed using Dart, a modern language that can it is compiled to the ARM or Javascript processor architecture. Flutter uses Dart to create a User Interface, making it easier to create an application because it uses one language (Dart) in the creation of UI and logic program. </p>

<p>Flutter has two types of widgets: StatelessWidget and StatefullWidget. Stateless widgets are used when the value (state/ configuration) of the widget never changes, and StatefullWidget is used when the value (state/configuration) of the widget is changeable. Both StatelessWidget and StatefullWidget both have a method named "build" that has BuildContext to position widgets within the widget tree. </p>

<p>In flutter there is a hot reload and hot restart function that is used to Application development with flutter. Hot reloads new source code added and delivered to an updated virtual machine dart. When you're done updating, darts, the virtual machine will update the UI according to the changes. Advantages of hot reload Is the prose time is fast compared to hot restart. But hot reloads maintain the state exists so that if you use the state then the value of the widget will not change. For, Hot restart will recompile the application and reset (destroy) the existing state. So
Hot restart will re-update the widget tree according to the updated code. </p>
