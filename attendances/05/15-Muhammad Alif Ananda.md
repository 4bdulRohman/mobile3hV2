today were learning about flutter.

What is Flutter app development? This toolkit is a cross-platform technology from Google, that allows creating application programs for mobile, desktop, and web use. It utilizes the Dart programming language, which in turn is based on the notorious Java. If you know Java/C#, assume you can program with Dart. The technology keeps up with the latest developments and is used by developers around the world. Most importantly, it is open-source and completely free.

Cross-platform applications are a long-standing dream of any business, because separate native iOS and Android apps are more expensive to develop and maintain. Flutter offers a quick way to create visually attractive apps for both operational systems, desktop computers, and the web from a single codebase. It is actively used and promoted by Google, and we expect that it will become universally popular in the near future.

here's few of the strengths of the Flutter software development framework:

# Low-cost app development
An ideal cross-platform should meet two requirements: provide a high-quality user experience (smooth animations, native UI elements without slowing down), and be cost-friendly from the development perspective.

 

The advantage of Flutter is not only in making one application instead of two. With this framework, you will also have fewer problems when adapting your app to each of the platforms. Most frameworks can cope, but that’s only if to consider them in the context of simple applications. The real problems begin when an application becomes “overgrown” with functions and inevitably gets complicated (it is about most products during the development stage).

# Own rendering engine
Flutter promises absolute freedom in creating a user interface regardless of the platform. This is achieved by the fact that the framework uses its own rendering engine to draw widgets.

 

The problem with many cross-platform solutions is that they look the same on iPhone and Android. But what about the companies that need to use Material Design for Android and Human Interface for iOS? For such companies, Flutter is the most suitable solution. It is equipped with packages that contain a set of custom widgets for both operating systems.

#Amazing design
Two powerful things were originally laid in the foundation of Flutter: an excellent programming language (Dart) and a fast, high-performance rendering engine (Skia). Such a choice was a well-thought-out solution that saves users from further long searches.

 

The result is an excellent platform that helps developers of all skill levels to create applications using appropriate design patterns and best practices. You can forget about contradictions to the standards or some technical flaws caused by the imperfections in the programming language. Flutter provides beautiful and customizable widgets that make Flutter apps look and feel great.
