In today's lesson we learned about Flutter framework for android app development.
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. 
Flutter apps are written in the Dart language and make use of many of the language's more advanced features.
On Windows, macOS, and Linux Flutter runs in the Dart virtual machine, which features a just-in-time execution engine. While writing and debugging an app, Flutter uses Just In Time compilation, allowing for "hot reload", with which modifications to source files can be injected into a running application. Flutter extends this with support for stateful hot reload, where in most cases changes to source code are reflected immediately in the running app without requiring a restart or any loss of state. For better performance, release versions of Flutter apps targeting Android and iOS are compiled with a head-of-time (AOT) compilation.
