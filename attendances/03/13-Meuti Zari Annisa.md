# Widget and Navigation

## Widget
Widget is main component to build UI in Android that inherits from View class. 

For checking the  available UI Widget, we can check it in the pallete in Android Studio.

**Set and Get value of widget**:
- EditText: Text etc
- ImageView: ImageResource etc
- RadioButton: Text, Checked
- CheckBox: Text, Checked

## Navigation Component
Navigation between different screens and apps is a core part of the user experience. The following principles set a baseline for a consistent and intuitive user experience across apps. It is designed to implement these principles by default, ensuring that users can apply the same heuristics and patterns in navigation as they move between apps.

**Destination**:
Every app you build has a fixed start destination as a first screen the user sees when they launch your app from the launcher. 
This destination is also the last screen the user sees when they return to the launcher after pressing the Back button.

> **Destinations** are the different content areas in your app
>
> **Actions** are logical connections between your destinations that represent paths that users can take
