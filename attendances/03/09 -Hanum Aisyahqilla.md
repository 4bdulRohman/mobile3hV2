<h3>Linear Layout</h3>
<p>LinearLayout is a box model â€“ widgets or child containers are lined up in a column or row, one after the next.
To configure a LinearLayout, you have five main areas of control besides the container's contents:  orientation, 
fill model, weight, gravity, padding , margin</p>

<h3>Relative Layout</h3>
<p>RelativeLayout places widgets based on their relationship to other widgets in the container and the parent container.  </p>

<h3>Table Layout</h3>
<p>Android's TableLayout allows you to position your widgets in a grid made of identifiable rows and columns.
Columns might shrink or stretch to accommodate their contents.  TableLayout works in conjunction with TableRow. 
TableLayout controls the overall behavior of the container, with the widgets themselves positioned into one or more TableRow containers, one per row in the grid.</p>

<h3>Scroll View</h3>
<p>When we have more data than what can be shown on a single screen you may use the ScrollView control.It provides a sliding or scrolling access to the data. This way the user can only see part of your layout at one time, but the rest is available via scrolling. This is similar to browsing a large web page that forces the user to scroll up the page to see the bottom part of the form. </p>
