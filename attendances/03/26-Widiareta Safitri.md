Basically, today's meeting we discussed about task B1 where the task is we have to understand what Layout is and its activities.

# Android Basic XML Layouts

In Android Basic XML Layouts, <b> LinearLayout </b> is the most common modeling tool. It offers a "box" model similar to the Java-Swing Box-Layout, the others like:
- LinearLayout (the box model), 
- RelativeLayout (a rule-based model), and 
- TableLayout (the grid model), along with 
- ScrollView, a container designed to assist with implementing scrolling containers. 
- Other (ListView, GridView, WebView, MapView,…) 

### Frame Layout
Frame Layout is Android’s simplest layout manager. A Frame Layout is a rectangular container that pins each child to its upper left corner. Adding multiple views to a frame layout just stacks one on top of the other (overlapping the views)

### Linear Layout

LinearLayout is a box model – widgets or child containers are lined up in a column or row, one after the next.
To configure a LinearLayout, you have five main areas of control besides the container's contents: 
orientation, fill model, weight, gravity, padding , margin

### Relative Layout
RelativeLayout places widgets based on their relationship to other widgets in the container and the parent container.

### Table Layout
- Android's TableLayout allows you to position your widgets in a grid made of identifiable rows and columns.
- Columns might shrink or stretch to accommodate their contents. 
- TableLayout works in conjunction with TableRow. 
- TableLayout controls the overall behavior of the container, with the - widgets themselves positioned into one or more TableRow containers, one per row in the grid

### ScrollView
ScrollView provides a sliding or scrolling access to the data. This way the user can only see part of your layout at one time, but the rest is available via scrolling
