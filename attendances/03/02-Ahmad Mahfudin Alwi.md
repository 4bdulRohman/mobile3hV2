## Widget

A widget is a small gadget or control of your android application placed on the home screen. Widgets can be very handy as they allow you to put your favourite applications on your home screen in order to quickly access them.

Widget is main component to build UI in Android.

### UI Hierarchy

The user interface (UI) for an Android app is built as a hierarchy of layouts and widgets. You need to define id in XML to manipulate Widget using Java or Kotlin

## Navigation Component

The Navigation component is designed to implement these principles by default, ensuring that users can apply the same heuristics and patterns in navigation as they move between apps.

### Destination

This is the first screen the user sees when they launch your app from the launcher. This destination is also the last screen the user sees when they return
to the launcher after pressing the Back button.
