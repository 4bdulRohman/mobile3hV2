<p>When creating a flutter project by default here is the folder structure and File. We can see the structure consists of .dart_tool, .idea, android, iOS, lib, test, .gitignore, .metadata, .packages, .flutter_basic.iml, pubspec.lock, pubspec.yaml, README.md.</p>

<p>Flutter uses Widget as an element of UI builder elements, this widget is program code that translates into views that can be viewed and interacted by the user. Stateless widgets are static/final where values or configurations have been initiated from the beginning, the variable value on this widget cannot be changed by this widget itself but it can be changed by its parent widget if the parent is Statefull Widget. </p>

<p>Statefull widgets are dynamic, they can be updated when needed accordingly with user action or if there is a change in data. Data changes to the statefull widgets triggered by state changes therefore a StatefullWidget always has State. </p>

<p>Container widgets are useful for storing a wide variety of attributes and accommodating various functions of objects. Container is a single child object which means only We can have one child widget, but in a container we can
place row, column, text and other containers. </p>
