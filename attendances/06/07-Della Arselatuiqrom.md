Summary Week 6 :

Flutter is an open source technology from Google that can be used to create Android and iOS apps.

Advantage :
1. Faster code writing
   Flutter has the advantage of Hot Reloading or making changes to the code that can be viewed directly in the app.

    With Hot Reload developers can change the code and can immediately see the results in the application.

    So, it will be very easy for developers who want to add features, fix bugs, and try to experiment.

    Hot Reload will also facilitate collaboration between developers and UI designers in experimenting to develop the appearance of the application.
   
2. One code for 2 platforms at once
   Flutter is a useful technology for building cross-platform applications with just one code.

    This one thing, of course, really helps mobile phone developers to do their job.

    The reason is that with only one code base, Android and iOS applications can be generated at the same time.

    Flutter is not platform dependent as it already has its own widgets and designs. That means there will be the same app on both platforms.
   
3. Exquisite design appearance
    Ease of making the application design look more beautiful.

    Flutter provides beautiful widgets that can be easily customized to make the app look more attractive.

    So, by using Flutter, it will be easier for developers of every skill level to make the application look better.
   
4. Easy to learn and use
    Flutter uses the Dart programming language. This programming language has the advantage that it is easy to learn and use.

    Dart is an object-oriented language that has a syntax similar to Java or C++, making it easy for beginners to learn.

    In addition, according to Freecodecamp Flutter can carry out the application development process because it does not require a lot of code so it is easier to use.

Disadvantage  :
1. Large file size
   File size is also one of the challenges of applications developed with Flutter. The reason is, the application file size tends to be larger. When compared to applications developed with Java or Kotlin, Flutter applications are indeed much larger in size.

2. The library is still not complete
   The next disadvantage of Flutter is that the library is still not very complete when compared to native development.
   
   Flutter can indeed be called still new so that not all functions needed by developers can be found in the library.
   
   Even so, Google's support for Flutter is so impressive that it's predictable that they will continue to improve the library and make it easier for users.

3. A growing community
   Flutter is still fairly new so the community is still growing. This is certainly not profitable if you want to ask questions about Flutter.
   
   Whether asking about resources or finding a mentor to learn Flutter is certainly quite difficult because there are still quite a few people who learn it.
   
   Not many developers have studied Dart and are proficient in developing applications with Flutter.
