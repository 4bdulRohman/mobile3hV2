>> Flutter is an open source framework created by Google. Google made
flutter with the goal of building a framework for creating modern, native UI
and reactive that can run on iOS and Android operating systems. Not only on
Google smartphones also make Flutter for desktop, web and embedded devices.
Flutter is programmed using Dart, a modern language that can
compiled to ARM processor architecture or javascript.

>> Flutter uses Dart to create a User Interface, making it easier to use
make applications because it uses one language (Dart) in making UI and logic
program. Flutter uses a declarative approach where Flutter builds the UI
follow the "State" owned by the application. When the state changes the UI will be drawn
repeat .

>> Flutter also makes it easier for programmers because from one program code can be compiled
to native ARM code, using the GPU and accessing the specific features of the smartphone either
using the iOS operating system or those using the Android operating system. So
with one time making the program can create 2 applications for the same operating system
different (iOS or Android).

>> The UI in Flutter is generated using Widgets, which is slightly different from the way of app development in general.
Widget is a concept in which the user interface is modeled after a LEGO block.
A new shape can be made up of numerous blocks, each of which can be different.
paired with a group of other blocks to create a new shape more complicated These widgets serve as the building blocks for Flutter apps.

>> StatelessWidget and StatefullWidget are the two types of widgets in Flutter. When the value (state/configuration) of the widget never changes, a stateless widget is used, and when the value (state/configuration) of the widget is subject to change, a StatefullWidget is used.Both StatelessWidget and StatefullWidget feature a build method that takes a BuildContext and sets the widget's location in the widget tree. More information on widgets and how to make them will be covered in the following chapter.
