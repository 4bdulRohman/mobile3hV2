The Flutter framework consists of both a software development kit (SDK) and their widget-based UI library. This library consists of various reusable UI elements, such as sliders, buttons, and text inputs. 
Developers building mobile applications with the Flutter framework will do so using a programming language called Dart. With a syntax like JavaScript, Dart is a typed object programming language that focuses on front-end development. 
Although Flutter is a newer cross-platform framework, more and more companies have chosen Flutter over frameworks such as Xamarin, Cordova, and React Native.  
Some of the top reasons why development teams choose Flutter include: 
•	Increased productivity. Using the same codebase for iOS and Android saves both time and resources. Flutter’s native widgets also minimize time spent on testing by ensuring there is little to no compatibility issues with different OS versions.
•	Easy to learn. Flutter allows developers to build native mobile applications without needing to access OEM widgets or use a lot of code. This, in addition to Flutter’s particularly appealing user interface, makes the mobile app creation process much simpler.  
•	Great performance. Users report that it is difficult to notice the difference between a Flutter app and a native mobile app.
•	Cost-effective. Building iOS and Android apps with the same codebase is essentially building two apps for the price of one.  
•	Available on different IDEs. Developers are free to choose between Android Studio and VS Code to edit their code on Flutter.  
•	Great documentation & community. Flutter has many great resources to answer your questions, thanks to its ample documentation with easy-to-follow use cases. Flutter users also benefit from community hubs like Flutter Community and Flutter Awesome for exchanging ideas.
