# Android Basic XML Layouts

Android’s simplest layout manager is Frame Layout, a rectangular container that pins each child to its upper left corner.

Commonly-used Android containers  
## 1. LinearLayout
LinearLayout is a box model, widgets or child containers are lined up in a column or row, one after the next.

## 2. RelativeLayout (a rule-based model)
Some positioning XML (boolean) properties mapping a widget according to its location respect to the parent’s place.

## 3. TableLayout (the grid model)
Android's TableLayout allows you to position your widgets in a grid made of identifiable rows and columns. TableLayout controls the overall behavior of the container, with the widgets themselves positioned into one or more TableRow containers, one per row in the grid.

## 4. ScrollView
ScrollView provides a sliding or scrolling access to the data. This way the user can only see part of your layout at one time, but the rest is available via scrolling. This is similar to browsing a large web page that forces the user to scroll up the page to see the bottom part of the form.

## 5. Other (ListView, GridView, WebView, MapView, etc).
