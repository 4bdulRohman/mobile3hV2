## Navigation Component
- Navigation between different screens and apps is a core part of the user experience. The following principles set a baseline for a consistent and intuitive user experience across apps
- The Navigation component is designed to implement these principles by default, ensuring that users can apply the same heuristics and patterns in navigation as they move between apps.

## Destination
- Every app you build has a fixed start destination.
- This is the first screen the user sees when they launch your app from the launcher. 
- This destination is also the last screen the user sees when they return to the launcher after pressing the Back button.
