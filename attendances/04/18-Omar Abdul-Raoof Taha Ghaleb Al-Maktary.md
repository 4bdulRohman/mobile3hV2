#In today’s lesson, we were asked to continue studying the material and work on APLAS projects. 
I have reached the last step of the last model C1 of java for android studio. C1 is about creating an Android application that contains several activities entitled MyLibrary.
For the material, we studied about ListView & RecyclerView:
ListView is used to show data which will be populated using an adapter in a vertical approach. The simplest adapter to use is called an ArrayAdapter because the adapter 
converts an ArrayList of objects into View items loaded into the ListView container.
RecyclerView is a ViewGroup that renders any adapter-based view in a similar way. 
Each individual element in the list is defined by a view holder object.  is supposed to be the successor of ListView and GridView. 
The RecyclerView requests those views, and binds the views to their data, by calling methods in the adapter. 
RecyclerView has built-in layout managers such as the following:
•	LinearLayoutManager shows items in a vertical or horizontal scrolling list.
•	GridLayoutManager shows items in a grid.
•	StaggeredGridLayoutManager shows items in a staggered grid.
